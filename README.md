## Electric Motor Temperature
### 140 hrs recordings from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)

The goals of this project are:
- Do exploratory data analysis.
- Do feature engineering.
- Create a sequential data preprocessing pipeline.
- Build a recurrent deep learning model.
- Build a 1d convolutional deep learning model.
- Build a hybrid (recurrent + convolutional) deep learning model.
- Compare the performance of the different deep learning models.
